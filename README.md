# Secret Family Recipes Cookbook Frontend

#### Prompt
- https://www.notion.so/Secret-Family-Recipes-Cookbook-ecf9be06b6044e9cb5e69eba6f82f658

#### Given Assets
- https://github.com/LambdaSchoolBuildWeeks/Unit1Marketing/raw/main/Secret%20Family%20Recipes.zip


#### MVP
1. On-boarding process for a new `user`
2. Ability to enter a new `recipe`, including `title`, `source` (ex: Grandma Ethel), `ingredients`, `instructions`, and `category` (dinner, chicken, dessert, pasta, etc) and edit or delete it later.
3. Homepage to view all entered `recipes`.
4. Ability to search for `recipes` by `title` or tagged `categories`.


#### Stretch
1. Ability to upload a `picture` of the original `recipe` along with the `recipe` entry.
2. By default all `recipe`s uploaded can only be viewed by the `user` logged in. A stretch goal would add the ability to invite another `user` with the link to view the `recipe`.
